<p>Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select &#8220;Take a Screenshot&#8221;. You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it&#8217;s very long, it might be best to crop it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use a tool like <a href="https://getfireshot.com/">FireShot</a> to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don&#8217;t need to purchase it.</p>

<p>Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.</strong></p>
